## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
weather <- readRDS("/Users/aaman10/Downloads/weather.rds")
weather
```

```{r}
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(weather)

# View the last 6 rows of data
tail(weather)

# View a condensed summary of the data
str(weather)
```


```{r}
# Check the class of bmi
class(bmi)

# Check the dimensions of bmi
dim(bmi)

# View the column names of bmi
names(bmi)
```


```{r}
# Check the structure of bmi
str(bmi)

# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Check the structure of bmi, the dplyr way
glimpse(bmi)

# View a summary of bmi
summary(bmi)
```


```{r}
# Print bmi to the console
bmi

# View the first 6 rows
head(bmi)

# View the first 15 rows
head(bmi, n = 15)

# View the last 6 rows
tail(bmi)

# View the last 10 rows
tail(bmi, n = 10)
```


```{r}
