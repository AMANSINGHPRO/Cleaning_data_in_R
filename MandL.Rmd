## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Explore the data
str(mario_kart)

# fit parallel slopes
lm(totalPr ~ wheels + cond, data = mario_kart)
```


```{r}
# Augment the model
augmented_mod <- augment(mod)
glimpse(augmented_mod)

# scatterplot, with color
data_space <- ggplot(augmented_mod, aes(x = wheels, y = totalPr, color = cond)) + geom_point()
  
# single call to geom_line()
data_space + 
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted))
```


```{r}
# build model
lm(bwt ~ age + parity, data = babies)
```
